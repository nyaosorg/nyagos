[top](../README.md) &gt; English / [Japanese](release_note_ja.md)

## Deprecations

* Remove `nyagos.d/catalog/neco.lua`
* Remove Lua function: `nyagos.msgbox`
* Remove the feature to define `grep` as an alias of `findstr.exe` when `grep.exe` does not exist. It was the undocumented feature.

## New features

* Ctrl-P/N: save the modified entry when switching history, and restore when switching again, until Enter is pressed
* Implement `nyagos.getkeys()` which returns the input key as a [sequence][keyseq] like `"\027[A"` instead of `nyagos.getkey()` which returns unicode.
* Enhance functions available in `nyagos.key[KEY] = function(this)...end`
    * [key-sequences][keyseq] like `"\007"` and `"\027[A"` are avaliable as KEY.
    * Implement `this:eval(KEYSEQUNCE)` that calls the function assigned to [KEYSEQUNCE][keyseq].
    * Implement `this:repaint()` that updates the screen
    * `this.pos` and `this.text` are automatically updated when methods are invoked.

## Documents

* Fix the broken links caused by renaming readme.md to README.md ( Thx @HAYASHI-Masayuki )
NYAGOS 4.4.15\_1
================
May.02, 2024

The binaries of this version are built with Go 1.20.14  
They support Windows 7, 8.1, 10, 11, WindowsServer 2008 or later, and Linux.

* (#442) Move back `aliasandset.lua` to `nyagos.d/` and enable to use the Lua codes like `set "ENV=VALUE"` and `alias "NAME=DEFINE"`.  In 4.4.15\_0, it was put on `nyagos.d/catalog/` and `require "aliasandset"` was neccessary to use (Thx @naoyaikeda)
* Fix: the day of the week part of %DATE% was incorrect  
  (%DATE% was expected like `2024/04/19 金`, but `2024/04/19 1919`)
* Fix the runtime error when `this:replacefrom(0,...)` is called in the key-handling lua-function. Instead, it returns {nil,error-message}

```lua
-- On 4.4.15, typing C-I causes crash of nyagos.
nyagos.key["C-I"] = function(this)
    assert(this:replacefrom(0,"XXXXX"))
end
```

* [SKK]
    * Fix the problem that `UTta` and `UTTa` were converted `打っtあ` and `▽う*t*t` instead of `打った`
    * Fix: manually input inverted triangles were recognized as conversion markers
    * Add the following the romaji-kana conversions:
        * `z,`→`‥`, `z-`→`～`, `z.`→`…`, `z/`→`・`, `z[`→`『`, `z]`→`』`,
            `z1`→`○`, `z2`→`▽`, `z3`→`△`, `z4`→`□`, `z5`→`◇`,
            `z6`→`☆`, `z7`→`◎`, `z8`→`〔`, `z9`→`〕`, `z0`→`∞`,
            `z^`→`※`, `z\\`→`￥`, `z@`→`〃`, `z;`→`゛`, `z:`→`゜` ,
            `z!`→`●`, `z"`→`▼`, `z#`→`▲`, `z$`→`■ `, `z%`→`◆`,
            `z&`→`★`, `z'`→`♪`, `z(`→`【`, `z)`→`】`, `z=`→`≒`,
            `z~`→`≠`, `z|`→`〒`, ``z` ``→`“`, `z+`→`±`, `z*`→`×`,
            `z<`→`≦`, `z>`→`≧`, `z?`→`÷`, `z_`→`―`,
        * `bya`→`びゃ` or `ビャ` ... `byo`→`びょ` or `ビョ`
        * `pya`→`ぴゃ` or `ピャ` ... `pyo`→`ぴょ` or `ピョ`
        * `tha`→`てぁ` or `テァ` ... `tho`→`てょ` or `テョ`
    * Implement `q` that convert mutually between Hiragana and Katakana during conversion.
* Sub commands completion (When `require "subcomplete"` is enabled)
    * Fix: the subcommand completion for scoop did not work because the filename of executable was `scoop.exe` that should be `scoop.cmd`.
* Fix the problem that prompt is not displayed on Linux  
  ( The .nyagos sample should have defined nyagos.env.PROMPT, but nyagos.env.prompt was defined )
* Fix: the loop to input commands for `foreach` could not be stopped with Ctrl-C  
  ( This problem was included in the commit [8bf0a2acb25b152d3d40c188de09858c2ef572ae] of version [4.4.6\_2]. See also issue [#383] and [4.4.6\_0] )

NYAGOS 4.4.14\_0 
================
Oct 06, 2023

The second half of 2023 edition.
The binaries of this version are built with Go 1.20.9.  
They support Windows 7, 8.1, 10, 11, WindowsServer 2008 or later, and Linux.

## New features

* nyagos.d/suffix.lua: Enabled automatic expansion of wildcards used in parameters of commands listed in `%NYAGOSEXPANDWILDCARD%` (for example: `nyagos.env.NYAGOSEXPANDWILDCARD="gorename;gofmt"` )
* [#432] Add new option: `glob_slash` to enable with the option of executable `--glob-slash`, calling lua function like `nyagos.option.glob_slash=true`, or executing command `set -o glob_slash`. When it is set, `/` is used on wildcard expansion.
* Support Japanese input method editor: [SKK] \(Simple Kana Kanji conversion program\) - [How To Setup][SKKSetUpEn]
* Add the lua-function: `nyagos.atou_if_needed` that converts the string that is not valid utf8 one to utf8-string as the current codepage string.

## Fixed bugs

* [#433] To avoid garbled characters, backquote uses `nyagos.atou_if_needed` to prevent UTF8 from being further converted to UTF8.
* Fix: On linux version, backquotation failed with error and did not work. ( because the lua function `atou` always returned "not supported", it is changed to returning the same value with given )
* [#432] When `set -o glob`, `*` and `?` double-quoted were expanded as wildcards (They should not be)
* Fix the problem that `more`, `nyagos.getkey`, and `nyagos.getviewwidth` might not work on Windows 7, 8.1 and Windows Server 2008 at [v4.4.13\_3].
* [#434] Fix: `nyagos.which('cp')` does not work as expect on Linux (Thanks to [@ousttrue])
* Fix: the background color of U+3000 was not changed to red

## Breaking changes

* `nyagos.default_prompt` and `nyagos.prompt` return the prompt-string instead of output it to the terminal directly. This modifying is to use the new field `PromptWriter` of the [go-readline-ny.Editor] instead of `Prompt` that is deprecated.
